    <h1>Project Team 9: Topic, COSI 116A F23</h1>

    <p><strong>Xiaoran Liu</strong>, <strong>Zixin Zhang</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>The project is driven by an interest in exploring the dynamics of educational spending per student and its
        impact on educational outcomes across different states in the United States. We seek to understand if there's a
        direct correlation between expenditure and student performance and how this relationship has evolved over time.
        The aim is to provide insights that could guide policy decisions and resource allocation in education.</em></p>



    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p><em>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><em>Color-Coded United States Maps: These maps are used to depict the trends in scores and expenditures
                over time. Each state is color-coded according to either its average student performance or educational
                spending, providing a geographical context to the data.</em></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Scatter Plot: This scatter plot is used to show the relationship between educational spending and
                NAEP test average score for each state. Each state is represented by a circle, with the x-axis representing the average
                expenditure per student and the y-axis representing the average score. The size of the circle is
                proportional to the number of students in the state. The scatter plot is interactive, allowing users to
                hover over each circle to see the state name on the plot.</em></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Heatmap: The heatmap illustrates the correlation between different types of educational expenditures
                and studentss' average NAEP test score, offering a quick and intuitive way to identify strong or weak
                correlations.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Our data analysis involved two primary datasets: 'states.csv' and '2022.csv'. The 'states_all.csv'
        dataset encompassed a comprehensive range of variables including yearly educational expenditures, student
        demographics, and NAEP average score across various states. The '2022.csv' dataset provided a more recent
        snapshot of educational spending and the NAEP average score.</em></p>
    <p><em>Both datasets included numerical data (e.g., expenditure amounts, student performance scores) and categorical
        data (e.g., state names). During preprocessing, we normalized expenditure figures to account for inflation and
        per-student spending differences, filled missing values using appropriate imputation methods, and converted data
        types for consistency and ease of analysis.</em></p>
    <p><em>These datasets were chosen for their relevance to our goal of understanding the relationship between
        educational spending and student outcomes at the state level. Their comprehensive nature allowed for a
        multifaceted analysis, ensuring our results would be robust and replicable.</em></p>
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>The primary tasks involved in our analysis were identifying trends in educational spending, correlating these
        trends with student performance metrics, and visualizing geographical variances. The goal was to provide
        actionable insights into how different spending strategies impact student outcomes and to highlight any regional
        disparities that might inform policy decisions.</em></p>
    <p><em>Abstract tasks included data cleansing, normalization, trend analysis, correlation detection, and data
        visualization. These tasks were crucial in transforming raw data into meaningful insights.</em></p>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p><em>Our design process began with basic sketches of potential visualizations, including scatter plots, heatmaps,
        and geographical maps. Through iterative refinement, these evolved into more sophisticated visualizations that
        effectively communicated complex data relationships.</em></p>
    <p><em>Design decisions were grounded in data visualization theory, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and
        accessibility. Feedback from initial user testing led to adjustments in color schemes for better visibility and
        enhancements in the interactivity of the visualizations to improve user engagement and understanding.</em></p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p><em>The project successfully highlighted key insights into the relationship between educational spending and
        student performance. It became evident that higher spending does not always correlate with improved outcomes,
        and regional disparities are significant. The visualizations provided a clear, engaging way to communicate these
        complex relationships.</em></p>
    <p><em>For future work, integrating more granular data, such as district-level spending or socio-economic factors,
        could offer a deeper understanding. Longitudinal studies to track the impact of educational policies over time
        would also be valuable.</em></p>
    <p><em>This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering and communicating trends
        in education, offering a foundation for more informed decision-making in this vital domain.</em></p>
